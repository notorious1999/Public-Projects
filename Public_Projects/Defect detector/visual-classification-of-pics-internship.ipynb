I leave here a link about the process : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4S0mKjXtT4\n\nThe goal of this notebook is to show you my a little about my work in Sweden. \n\nI had two Dataset of pictures : one from a camera at 90° about the tray and an other from a camera based on the optical tomography technology with a little angle this time. Those optical tomography (OT) pictures works as a thermal camera : it is red when the area represents a defect (depending on the threshold used by the operator) and blue when the part does not. I have not the right to use the pictures and the statistics table of all the steps of my work but the goal of this notebook is to show you what I did in Sweden overall.\n\nThe idea here was to use an pre-trained encoder feed by the camera pictures and the OT pictures to decode the defect pictures. The encoder enabled me to extract the main features of the pictures and the decoder to assert if those features extracted are great or not. Then, I used TSNE on the output from the encoder for visualization in order to see if there is some clusters or not and more important, if each cluster represents a particular defect. Hopefully, the result was great (each dot represent a picture) and checked by the experts of additive manufacturing :"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"Image(\"../input/results/Capture.PNG\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Preprocessing of the pictures\n\n**The issues here is to import and crop the pictures. Then, we will have to focus the pictures on the defected area. For that, I will use the work I had done before this mission which was to define the defects with some statistics. One of those statistics are the surface and the boundaries of the defected area. Knowing that, it is simpler to succeed on this task. Finally, I have to change the perspective of the OT pictures. Previously, I wrote that the OT camera take pictures not perfectly vertically, unlike the \"normal\" camera, and it exists a little angle. I solved this problem by using a perspective matrix. To image my statement, you could make a parallel with the scanner application on your smartphone which change the perspective of your picture to have the document in front of you. I could say that 90% of the difficulty was in this part. In fact, importing the pictures was really tricky because they were spread in different files with different names and for the statistics, sometimes, there was some missing values and columns which was the problem from the API of the 3D printer. You could see below this long work on the preprocessing.**"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"***Importation of the pictures and the statistic tables (for each job).
